I am particularly drawn to amateur radio activities that involve interesting, unusual, and marginal propagation, and 
radio bands that exhibit such propagation characteristics. I get most excited by VHF weak signal operation, taking advantage of 
Tropo, Sporadic-E, Aurora, and meteor scatter propagation. I also love DX-ing on the HF bands, in particular the low bands. 
My favourite bands are 6m, 2m, 10m, 80m, and 160m, and my favourite mode is CW, though I operate SSB/AM and digital modes
(mainly on VHF) too.

I am also very interested in the history and development of radio and telegraphy, and love aspects of radio operating that are 
rooted in that history -- casual low-band CW operating, AM operating, traffic handling & structured/formal operating, 
homebrew radio, etc.

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
I decided to get my amateur radio license when I was in grad school in 2012. I 
had been at UBC for about a year, and was due for a distraction. My interest in
radio goes back much further, though. I can remember going to my grandfather's 
cottage in the summers where he had a beautiful Telefunken shortwave radio that
he had bought in Germany when he was stationed there in the 50's. We would 
listen to stations from all over the world, and I thought it was just the 
coolest. I can also remember staying up late in my bedroom as a kid, listening 
to AM broadcast stations coming up the East coast from Boston and New York. In 
2010, while doing my undergrad degree in Montreal, I got thinking about 
shortwave radio and had probably done some reading on the internet, and set 
out to buy a Grundig shortwave radio. I had a great time with it, DX'ing 
broadcast stations, finding pirate signals, coming across a few number stations,
and eventually figuring out how to listen to the hams using SSB. I can 
remember a time that I brought my Grundig home with me when I visited for 
Christmas. I heard all kinds of ham SSB activity on that trip, and I suppose 
that was when the seed was planted.

I am currently running an Icom IC-7300 into a 20m dipole on my apartment deck.
